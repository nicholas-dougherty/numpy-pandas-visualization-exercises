## Elaborating on the Subject Matter
#### Numpy 

Numpy is a library for representing and working with large and multi-dimensional arrays. Most other libraries in the data-science ecosystem depend on numpy, making it one of the fundamental data science libraries.     
Numpy provides a number of useful tools for scientific programming. Convention is to import it like so: 
```
import numpy as np
```
Provides capabilities pertaining to:
- Indexing
    - An Array type that goes beyond built-in lists.
        - Create a numpy array by passing a list to the np.array function. 
        - Make it multi-dimensional by passing a list of lists to np.array
- Vectorized Operations
    - Vectorizing operations means that operations are automatically applied to every element in a vector
        - Not only are the arithmatic operators vectorized;the same applies to comparison operators.
- Array Creation (several methods)
    - np.random.randn; np.zeros; np.ones; np.full; np.arange; np.linspace
- Array Methods
    - .min; .max; .mean; .sum; .std (standard deviation)
